### About Us

"AgriLink" was founded by a group of students from Thapathali Campus who saw the struggles faced by local farmers. Despite the abundance of fertile land and skilled farmers, the country was still importing a large amount of produce from other countries. Meanwhile, local farmers were struggling to sell their products, often receiving low prices for their hard-earned produce.

We saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers, creating a platform that connects farmers directly with buyers, eliminating the need for middlemen and ensuring that food dollars stay within the local economy. Our mission is to support sustainable agriculture and local communities, and help farmers get fair prices for their produce.

With "AgriLink", we aim to provide a simple and efficient solution for both farmers and buyers. The platform offers a wide selection of fresh, locally grown produce, and makes it easy for buyers to find what they need. By purchasing produce directly from farmers, buyers can feel confident that they're making a positive impact on the environment and their local community.

We believe that by connecting farmers and buyers directly, we can help to create a sustainable food system that benefits everyone. Join us on our mission to support sustainable agriculture and local communities.
